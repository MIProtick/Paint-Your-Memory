# Paint Your Moment

***Image Colorization***, a task of coloring monochrome and old images, plays an 
important role in the human perception of visual information to B&W pictures.

&nbsp;
## Description

There exist a large number of historic photographs which contain an insufficient 
amount of colors and luminance information. Colorizing those images will help us 
in recreating those moments and a better perception of the old times. 

Technically speaking, many of the recent developments in colorization 
involve images that contain a common theme or require highly processed data such 
as semantic maps as input.
